My jQuery HTML Project
This is a simple HTML project that demonstrates the use of jQuery to dynamically modify the content of a web page.

Installation
To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine:


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/tanwarabhinandan/Project.git


Once you've cloned the repository, open the index.html file in your web browser to view the web page. You should see a button labeled "Click me" on the page.

Clicking the button will use jQuery to modify the text content of a p element on the page. The jQuery code is located in the script.js file in the js directory.

Feel free to modify the jQuery code to experiment with different ways of modifying the page content!
